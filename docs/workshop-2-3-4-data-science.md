# Data Scientist visualises and analyses prepared data, experiments and trains model.

## Introduction
In our second workshop sub-module the data scientist begins their work - also with a dedicated Jupyter Notebook. They analyse and visualise the data prepared by the data engineer in the previous step.

Then then exeriment with different training algorithms, _DecisionTreeClassifier_ and _RandomForestClassifier_, and picks the best one.

Then then train the model using their selected algorithem.

This diagram highlights the flow at this stage:

Go ahead and start it up - and you'll again see the Spawn page - this time select the Data Science focused image, based on Elyra - which we built to save time and keep a consistent image across the organisation:
