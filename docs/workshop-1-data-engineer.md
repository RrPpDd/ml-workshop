Once in the terminal clone the repository - which will pull it into your Jupyter Hub - and allow us open the notebooks:
```
git clone https://github.com/masoodfaisal/ml-workshop
```

Now go back to your file list page and you'll see the new folder you just cloned _ml-workshop_. Drill into docs/ and open
